# Contact Form with React.js Tutorial

This is the code written from these YouTube tutorials I made for all of you!

## Getting Started to Follow Along

(If you haven't installed `npm`, you will need it. Do that by typing in `brew install npm`.)

1. Navigate to your terminal and the directory where you want to make the app (ie. `cd Desktop`).

2. Install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with `npm install -g create-react-app`.

3. Create app with `create-react-app contact-form-react`.

4. After it installs dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), navigate to the new directory with `cd contact-form-react`.

5. Start your engines (and port 3000) with `npm start`.

You will now be navigated to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where your code is running!
